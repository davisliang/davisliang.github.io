I am an Applied Scientist at [AWS AI](https://amazon.jobs/en/internal/teams/amazonai), working in natural language processing (information retrieval, question answering, machine translation, representation learning, etc.). My current academic pursuits involve understanding the underpinnings of how foundation models learn. 

At Amazon, I work with a group of wonderful scientists whose creativity and enthusiasm are the primary reasons why I have not abandoned society to peddle art NFTs from a sizeable digital estate in the Fashion Street district of Decentraland.

Prior to Amazon, I worked as a Software Engineer at Yahoo and obtained my MS degree in Computer Science from UC San Diego, where I was advised by [Prof. Gary Cottrell](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gary/). During my undergrad, I was fortunate enough to work with [Prof. Michael J Tarr](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/people/core-training-faculty/tarr-michael.html) exploring how humans perceive faces and scenes.

### Research Interests
I am interested in:
* Robust Machine Learning, in particular machine learning models that are robust to noises and distribution shift.
* ML for Social Good, in particular tackling issues in fairness, bias, and misinformation.
* Multilingual Systems, with a focus on zero-shot transfer to low-resource languages.
* Foundation Models and unsupervised methods for representation learning.
