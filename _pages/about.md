I am an Applied Scientist at [AWS AI](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/), working towards solving ongoing problems in natural language processing (information retrieval, question answering, machine translation, representation learning, etc.).

Prior to Amazon, I worked as a Software Engineer at Yahoo and obtained my MS degree from UC San Diego, where I was advised by [Prof. Gary Cottrell](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gary/). During my undergrad, I was fortunate enough to work with [Prof. Michael J Tarr](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/people/core-training-faculty/tarr-michael.html) exploring the human perception of faces and scenes.
