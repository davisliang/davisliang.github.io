I am an Applied Scientist at [AWS AI](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/), working towards solving ongoing problems in natural language processing (information retrieval, question answering, machine translation, representation learning, etc.).

Prior to Amazon, I obtained my MS degree from UC San Diego, where I was advised by [https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gary/](Prof. Gary Cottrell). During my undergrad, I was fortunate enough to work under [https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/people/core-training-faculty/tarr-michael.html](Prof. Michael J Tarr) exploring human perception of faces and scenes.
