I am an Applied Scientist at AWS AI, working towards solving ongoing problems in natural language processing (information retrieval, question answering, machine translation, representation learning, etc.). My current academic pursuits involve understanding the underpinnings of how foundation models learn (and how to improve existing representation learning algorithms). At Amazon, I work with a group of wonderful scientists at [Amazon AI](https://amazon.jobs/en/internal/teams/amazonai) whose creativity and enthusiasm are the primary reasons why I have not abandoned society to live out my lifelong dream of becoming a modern surrealist (think Salvador Dali but on TikTok peddling art NFTs).   

Prior to Amazon, I worked as a Software Engineer at Yahoo and obtained my MS degree in Computer Science from UC San Diego, where I was advised by [Prof. Gary Cottrell](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gary/). During my undergrad, I was fortunate enough to work with [Prof. Michael J Tarr](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/people/core-training-faculty/tarr-michael.html) exploring the human perception of faces and scenes.

## research
I am interested in
* Robust Machine Learning, in particular machine learning models that are robust to noises and distribution shift.
* ML for Social Good, in particular tackling issues in fairness, bias, and misinformation.
* Multilingual Systems, with a focus on zero-shot transfer to low-resource languages.
* Foundation Models and unsupervised methods for representation learning.
